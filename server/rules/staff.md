# Staff Rules
1.  Patience is the key for a staff member. You will encounter many situations where you must have patience to deal with said situation, and not take any actions in haste. Conversing with other staff members in such situations is not only recommended, but required. Thus, do not act rashly; consider all possible outcomes and seek advice before proceeding.
2.  Abuse of authority is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: wrongly punishing players, favoring one player over others, and failing to deliver correct judgment in specific situations.
3.  You should not build administrative abilities in player maps without developer permission.
4.  You should not modify, delete, or build in the private maps of other people without their permission or the developer's permission. If it is absolutely necessary to make such a change, the developer must be notified immediately with the reason and the specific changes or deletion performed.
5.  You should not change or set data of the server or a specified player unless it is strictly necessary, in which case you must report it to the developers with the exact change you made.
6.  You should not move other players unless it is strictly necessary (for example, if a player is stuck).
7.  You should not share any private staff information or server data with non-staff members. All internal discussions and proprietary information must remain confidential. This rule still applies even after you are demoted from the staff.
8.  You should not use staff tools or abilities to gain a personal advantage over other players in standard gameplay. Staff duties are separate from personal play.
9.  All staff members are expected to maintain a respectful and professional demeanor when interacting with the community and other staff members. Personal conflicts should not interfere with staff duties.
